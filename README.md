# chess-game-with-ML-
I created a chess project that aims to incorporate chess rules, visualize chess games, and later develop a machine learning model capable of making optimal moves.

The file chess.py contains the classes representing chess pieces and the Board class, which manages the arrangement of pieces and enforces the rules of chess during gameplay.
The file chess_game_ui.py handles the visualization of the board and pieces.
